# Exploring the Database Online
OFET Database is viewable as a table with interactive filtering and sorting, via this link:
## [Explore the Database](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Imperssonator/OFET-Database/blob/master/OFET-Table.ipynb)


### Create plots via MatLab GUI

[Download](https://github.com/Imperssonator/OFET-Database/archive/master.zip) the repository to your MatLab active directory.

Run the following command:

OFET_GUI()

Or simply right click on the file "OFET_GUI.m" and select "Run".
A window will pop up from which you can select process constraints and generate plots of mobility against many different independent variables. Minor bugs may be encountered - close the GUI and restart it to reset all fields.

## Exploring the Database as Raw Data
[Download](https://github.com/Imperssonator/OFET-Database/archive/master.zip) the repository to your MatLab active directory.

Run the following command:

load('Functions/OFETDatabase.mat')

The Database should now exist as a structure array called "OFET" in your workspace. Open it in the variable explorer to interact with the raw data.

## View individual papers as Excel sheets
[Download](https://github.com/Imperssonator/OFET-Database/archive/master.zip) the repository to your MatLab active directory.

Open the "Papers" folder, then open the folder for any author, and open the .xlsx file for that paper.

## Add/Edit a paper

#### If you use Git:
* Clone the repository and make your own branch
* Create your own folder in the folder "Papers" and generate your process spreadsheet following the instructions below
* Commit changes to your branch
* Submit a pull request so your changes can be merged back to the master branch

#### If you don't use Git:
* [Download](https://github.com/Imperssonator/OFET-Database/archive/master.zip) the repository to your local machine
* Create your own folder in the folder "Papers" and generate your process spreadsheet following the instructions below
* Email to npersson3@gatech.edu

### How to Add a New Paper
* Create a new folder in the folder "Papers" and name it "\<First Author's Last Name> \<Year of Publication>"
* From the main folder, copy "New Paper Template.xlsx" and add it to your new folder in "Papers"
* Each column in this spreadsheet represents one device
* Each row stores one piece of process information, such as the number average molecular weight of your starting material (Mn)
* Fill in as much information as you can - blank rows are common and perfectly acceptable
* Please use the units specified for each row, which can be found in "Process Variables.xlsx" in the main folder
* For categorical variables such as "solvent", choose from the listed options in "Process Variables.xlsx"
* Spelling and capitalization are important for categorical variables

* Take a look at some of the other papers' spreadsheets as an example
